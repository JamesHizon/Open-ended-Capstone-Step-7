# Open-ended Capstone Step-7

This repository will include architecture diagram where I implement AWS Cloud solutions to extract, preprocess and load data, in addition to the different possible analytics solutions (see attached diagram).

In addition, attached is a snapshot of creating an AWS Resource Template using AWS CloudFormation.
I have created an AWS CloudFormation Template (Azure Resource Equivalent) which includes AWS S3 Bucket, a few EMR Clusters, AWS Athena DataCatalog to observe metadata, AWS CloudWatch Dashboard, in addition to AWS QuickSight dashboard.

Later on, I may need to make edits in regards to the Properties if I want to build a Stack in AWS CloudFormation.

### Important Link
The following includes a link to an example AWS CloudFormation template implementation of EMR, where I can simply type a "Google Search" on other Cloud resources if I'd like to observe which properties to include inside the AWS EMR Template.
